Tetris clone written in Swift for the iOS platform. This Bloc Book is meant for educational purposes only.


Tools we'll be using: Swift, SpriteKit and Xcode.


Swift

Swift is Apple's latest programming language. In time it will replace Objective-C as the primary language in which iPhone and Macintosh applications are written. Swiftris is written entirely in Swift and this book will present a wide variety of the language's capabilities.

If you are not a programmer, do not worry. Regardless of skill level, you will have your very own copy of Swiftris after completing this guide. However, this book does not intend to teach you the language in its entirety. Several aspects of it will be covered in brief and supplemented by external resources.

SpriteKit

SpriteKit is a set of APIs provided by the iOS SDK (software development kit) which allow native 2D game development from within Xcode. Swiftris is powered by SpriteKit and therefore no additional libraries or 3rd party tools will be required to build this great game.

Xcode

Xcode 6 is required for Swift development. Download Xcode 6 before continuing.
